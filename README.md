# ePortofolio for API-Documentation with Apiary.io
## Create Apiary-Account
The first step to create your API-Documentation is to create an Account on [Apiary.io](http://apiary.io/), which is the Cloud-Platform of API-Blueprint. You could also code your API-Documentation locally by using API-Blueprint itself, which is available [here](https://apiblueprint.org/).
### Sign-In
Go to [Apiary.io](http://apiary.io/) and press Sign Up, which should let you create an account by using your e-mail address or by logging in with your existing GitHub or Twitter-Account. Logging in with your GitHub-Account will give you automatically sync of your API-Documentation  with your GitHub-Repository.
### Create First API
After you've signed up you're instantly prompted to create your first API-Documentation. Just give it a name you like, but make sure to start you API in *API-Blueprint*. After pressing *Save and Start using Apiary*, you're ready to go.
